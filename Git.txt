GIT PROTOCOLS 
	http(s) -> in 80/443   for read-write, requires password for auth, firewall friendly   eg: https://github.com/cold-tea/something.git
	git -> in 9418     for read-only, anonymous only              eg: git://github.com/cold-tea/something.git
	ssh -> in 22       for read-write, SSH keys for auth          eg: git@github.com/cold-tea/something.git
	file -> locally
 
Commands ->
	echo "# cotiviti-demo" >> README.md
	git init
		.git hidden folder generated.. This is where the object is stored (local repo)
	(open .git) -> will open the git folder
	git add README.md    /     git add .
	git commit -m "first commit"
	git remote add origin https://github.com/cold-tea/cotiviti-demo.git
	git remote -> displays the origin information
	git remote -v -> prints the repository url
	git push -u origin master -> push to github
	git pull origin master -> update working copy from the repo
	git fetch <link>   -> fetches but donot merge
	git pull <link> -> fetches + merge
	
	git status -s   -> check if any file is modified. 
	git status -> check the git staging area
	git reset -> remove from staging area
		git reset --soft <hash>  -> return to that commit(hash) but keep changes in the staging area
		git reset --mixed(default donot need to add this) <hash>  -> return to that commit(hash) keep changes out of the staging area
		git reset --hard <hash>  -> return to that commit(hash) and deletes every other files not associated to that previous commit
			-> this --hard option still donot removes the untracked file
			-> to clean it run command (git clean -df)
		git clean   -> removes all changes to the head of the commit
	
	git config --global user.name "Sandesh Pokhrel"
	git config --global user.email "sandesh.pokhrel56@gmail.com"
	git config --list -> lists all the configurations
	git log      -> git log of existing commits
	git log --stat   -> displays which file are added/subtracted/modified on commits
	git log --oneline  -> commits in condensed form
	git log --oneline | wc -l  -> count commits line by line
	git log --oneline --graph  -> displays different merges and  branches happened
	git shortlog   -> displays all the authors and the commits they have made so far
	git shortlog -sne  -> summary, desc from num of commits, email
	git show HEAD
	git show HEAD~10   -> 10 step backward from the head commit
	
	NEED HELP->
		git help <verb>
		git <verb> --help
	GITIGNORE FILE->
		content listed in (.gitignore) will be skipped by the git (run git status to check it)
	MISTAKE IN COMMIT MESSAGE
		git commit --amend -m "New rectified latest commit" -> changes the last commit placed to mentioned message
		git commit --amend  -> exit and see the new file if changed or modified will be placed on the last commit itself without placing new
	MISTAKENLY ADDED ON ANOTHER BRANCHES
		git cherry-pick <hash of commit from another branch to selected branch>  -> brings the commit from another branch to selected branch
			and to another branch run (git reset --hard <previous commit hash> etc..)
		git reflog   -> prints the action history with hash
		git checkout <hash of hard reset log known after running (git reflog)>  
			-> if commit is not moved to another branch and accidentally removed from this branch with hard reset then it again bring back to the hardly deleted hash if the hash provided is same
		git branch backup  -> moves the head of the branch where accidentally removed and restoration took place to this backup branch
		git revert <hash>   -> reverts from that <hash> to the previous one
		git checkout <filename>    OR     git reset --hard -> get the file from the head of the commit. Reseting all uncomitted changes made to that file
Plumbing commands ->
	OBJECTS
		echo "hello" | git hash-object --stdin      generates the sha1 hash object for "hello"
			every object in the git has the sha1 -> commits, files, releases etc...
			first 2 digit of sha1 is used as folder name, other remaining digits in actually the content
		git cat-file <sha1 code>    -> prints out the content of that commit	
			-p -> for the contents
			-t -> for the type (blob or tree)
				tree has the info about the file info inside it
				blob is not the file name but the content inside the file
		-- from the second commit onwards we have parent which points to the previous commit sha1
		git tag -a mytag -m "I love cheesecake"   -> Simply a level attached to an object		
		git tag   -> displays the list of tags
		git cat-file [<tag-name> OR <tag-hash>]  -> in case of tag both tag name or tag hash can be given.
			Git objects -> (blobs, trees, commits, tags)
			
	BRANCHES
		git branch  -> check branches
		git branch -a
			all branches stored inside .git>refs>heads> <branches>  -> cat .git/refs/heads/master  prints the sha1 of last commit to trunk
		git branch <branch-name> -> new branch created
		git branch -d <branch-name> -> delete the branch
		git push origin --delete <branch-name> -> commit the deleted branch change on repository
		git checkout <branch-name> -> switch to that branch for doing work
		git branch --merged   -> check which branch are merged into current selected branch
		git merge <new-branch>     -> merge into master
		git rebase <new-branch>   ->  same like merge but rewrites the commit history
		git rebase -i <new-branch>   -> gives the opportunity to modify the commits
	
	CLONE
		git remote -v -> prints the repository url
		git clone <repo-url>
			git clone ../local-repo.txt
			git clone https:/<some url>
	DIFF and MERGE
		git diff -> displays the difference in working copy and working base
			if git diff displays something then git status will also list something
		git diff <hash1> <hash2> -> displays differences between two commit hashes\
		git diff <filename>  -> check the difference in that file
		git diff head~1..head -> diff between head and one step backward from head
		git diff <some char of second sha>..<some char of head sha>
		
	ADD
		git add -A   OR   git add --all -> add everything for the staging (recursively through every changed files and directories)
		git add -A myDir/   OR   git add myDir/ -> everything inside that directory recursively
		git add --no-all myDir/    OR    git add --ignore-removal myDir/     -> ignores staging of deleted files
		git add -u   -> stage all the tracked files and folders
		git add .    -> current directory... works recursively but doesnot come to the top like git add -A
		
	STASH
		git stash save "The change is saved"   -> save the changes in stash. changes is not reflected while runnining (git status) . 
			Useful if needs to switch to another branch making changes without commiting in present branch. The switched branch also wont notice the changes happened
			in the particular file. The change made is also not reflected in any branches also not in the branch from where the change is made.
		git stash list -> Lists the content in stash  (result -> stash@{0}: On master: amend.txt is modified)
		git stash apply stash@{0}  -> bring back the changes but the stash list is not cleared
		git stash pop  -> pop out the top from stash list and apply the changes (similar to above but clear the content)
		git stash drop stash@{0} -> drop the record from the stash list
		git stash clear -> clear everything from the stash
		--useful if the change is made in one branch but supposed to be done in another. so save in stash and switch to other branch and apply changes
