		echo "hello" >> hello.txt --- append
			these above commands only redirects and donot print anything thing in the console
		echo "hello" | tee <-a> hello.txt --- append/overwrite and print in the console as well
		
	text processors commands ---
		cut --- cuts the part of line from file or piped data

			cut -c 1-5 <filename> --- outputs char from index 1 to 5
			cut -c 1-3,6-8 <filename>
			cut -d : -f 1 /etc/passwd --- get first field of each line delimited by :
		awk --- test processing utility
			awk -F : '{print $1}' /etc/passwd --- get first field of each line delimited by :
			awk -F : '{print $1,$3}' /etc/passwd
			awk -F : '{print $NF}' /etc/passwd --- last field
			ls -l | awk -F : '{print $1}'
			awk '/sandesh/ {print}' /etc/passwd --- search for line with word 'sandesh'
			echo "Hello World" | awk '{$2="Sandesh"; print $0}' --- replace second word by 'Sandesh'
			echo "Hello:World" | awk -F : '{$2="Sandesh"; print $0}'
			expolre this further more as it has lot of functionalities
		grep/egrep --- prints the line for which the given pattern matches
			grep sandesh <filename> --- prints line containing sandesh in file
			cat hello.txt | grep sandesh
			grep -c sandesh <filename> --- count word sandesh in file
		diff --- similar to git. show the differences in files
			diff <file1> <file2>
		sort/uniq ---
			sort <filename>
			sort -k 2 <filename> --- sort by 2nd field seperated by space.
				can specify delimeter as well
			uniq <filename> --- show only unique characters
		sed --- replace the text
			sed 's/Hello/Hi/g' <filename> --- replaces all 'Hello' by 'Hi'
			sed -i 's/Hello/Hi/g' <filename> --- replaces all 'Hello' by 'Hi' and write in file
			sed '/Hello/d' <filename> --- delete 'Hello' in filename
				

####### FILE PERMISSIONS
	File and Directory Permissions (chmod)
		3 types of permissions
			r - read
			w - write
			x - execute
		each permissions can be controlled from three levels
			u - user = yourself
			g - group
			o - other
		command to change permission
			chmod g-w hello --- remove write from group similar for u and o
			chmod a-r hello --- remove read from all i.e u, g and o
			chmod a+x hello --- grant execute to all
			chmod u+rw hello --- read write to user
			chmod ug+r --- read to user and group
		using numeric mode
			0 - no permissions
			1 - execute
			2 - write
			4 - read
			chmod 700 hello --- grant all to user and none to other
			chmod 764 --- all to u, rw to g, read to other
	File Ownership permissions (chown, chgrp)
		chown --- change the user ownership of the file
		chgrp --- change the group ownership of the file
		chown root hello --- set root as owner
		chgrp root hello --- set root as group
	Access Control List (ACL)
		assign permission to random user or group
		setfacl -m u:usr_name:rwx /path/filename --- to user usr_name
		setfacl -m g:grp_name:rwx /path/filename --- to group grp_name
		setfacl -x u:usr_name /path/filename --- revoke all for user
		setfacl -b /path/filename --- remove all
